Hi, my name is Congying Xia. I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Philip S. Yu. Prior to that, I received B.S. and M.S. from University of Science and Technology, Beijing.

My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, like named entity reconition and intent detection. In particular, I am interested in understanding natural language in low-resource senarios such as zero-shot learning and few-shot learning.


I interned at Salesforce Research, Google AI and Tecent Medical AI lab during the PHD period.
